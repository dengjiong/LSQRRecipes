This directory contains examples showing the usage of the RANSAC
algorithm to estimate various parametric objects.

The following examples also output 3D scenes:
1. lineEstimation
2. planeEstimation
3. rayIntersection
4. sphereEstimation

These 3D scenes visually illustrate the results of using a least
squares solution as compared to wrapping it with the RANSAC
algorithm. The output file format is OpenInventor. You can display
it using the viewer found in the coin3DViewer directory
(win32 command line application).
